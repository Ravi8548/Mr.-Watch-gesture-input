Academic Hardware Project | Embedded & IoT

Mr. Watch is an innovative wireless gesture-based input device designed to function as a wearable pointing and navigation tool for presenters. It offers a hands-free, cable-free interaction experience by translating wrist gestures into actionable input commands.

ðŸ”¹ Key Contributions:

Developed a custom embedded system that captures hand/wrist movements using motion sensors (e.g., accelerometer/gyroscope).

Integrated wireless communication (e.g., RF/Bluetooth) to transmit signals from the wearable device to a receiver.

Implemented gesture recognition logic for functions like next/previous slide, cursor control, and click actions.

Designed the device as a watch-style wearable, providing both portability and comfort during use.

ðŸ”¹ Impact:

Eliminated the need for traditional wired remotes or laser pointers during presentations.

Enhanced user mobility and convenience, especially for educators, speakers, and conference presenters.

Demonstrated the power of gesture recognition and wearable technology in real-time control systems.

This project highlights a creative fusion of hardware design, embedded programming, and user-centric innovation, paving the way for next-generation human-computer interaction devices.
